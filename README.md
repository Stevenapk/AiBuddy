# AI Buddy

## Concept and Features

AI Buddy is a simple messaging app reminiscent of iMessage. However, instead of contacts, you can define your own characters. Want to text Selena Gomez as if she was your friend from high school? Why Not? Want a budget travel guide for the state or country you live in? No problem. 

The idea of the app is to have fun and create a sort of list of different characters you can talk to. This could be for character building in a book you're writing. It could be to get different celebrity opinions or learn about their lives and habits. You could create an expert list of people in different interests to go to for advice. Really anything you can imagine. 

## Tools

The project was created in SwiftUI using the MVVM design pattern. It makes use of OpenAI through backend cloud function requests with Firebase for authentication. It also has a high test coverage using XCTest. 

## Other Features

Other features include characters randomly texting you first, characters taking into account context of your conversation where necessary, specifying unique behaviors and attitudes for them, a text-message-like quality to the way they message you, and adding custom contact images for each character.
